Open Educational Resource project
=================================

In this course, we will attempt to produce [open educational resources](#what-are-open-educational-resources):

1. [A textbook](#how-do-i-produce-a-textbook)
2. [Educational videos](#how-do-i-produce-educational-videos) $25,000 prize
3. [Assessments (tests) that teach](http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Telling-Students-to-Study/131622/)

Umm...

- [What's the point](#whats-the-point)?
- But [I'm just a student](#but-im-just-a-student-i-cant-do-this)!
- [How will I be graded](#how-will-i-be-graded-on-my-contributions)?

What are open educational resources?
------------------------------------
[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licensed material for teaching and learning.

Examples:

- <http://www.khanacademy.org/>
- <http://www.saylor.org/>

But I'm just a student! I can't do this!
----------------------------------------
Professors, including myself, easily forget what we did not know.
Professors also forget the misconceptions we once held.

[Misconceptions matter](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/khan-academy-and-the-effectiveness-of-science-videos/). Anything we produce must include misconceptions to debunk them.

The professor asks questions in class to collect misconceptions (and take attendance).

How will I be graded on my contributions?
-----------------------------------------
You won't be. Instead, you will receive feedback. Of course, if you contribute nothing, you cannot pass or receive feedback.

Followup:

- [How can I evaluate my own work](#how-can-i-evaluate-my-own-work)?

How can I evaluate my own work?
-------------------------------
Do:
- Check spelling, grammar, punctuation.
- Use active voice. For example: the professor wrote this document.
- Use the appropriate tense.
- Work together
- Ask and answer questions

Avoid:
- Weasel words, filler phrases. Examples: "the process of", "considered to be"
- Spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors
- Passive voice. For example, this document was written by the professor.
- Plagiarism (misrepresenting someone else's work as your own). For example, copying from Wikipedia.
- Adding [generated files](#what-are-generated-files) into [version control](git.md)
- Second person. Say "you" only when absolutely necessary.

Follow:
- Strunk & White. Elements of Style.
- [These criteria](http://www.saylor.org/open-textbook-challenge-peer-review-criteria/).

What are generated files?
-------------------------
The output of a compiler (e.g., binary or executable files).

What's the point?
-----------------
The point is to learn by teaching. Not just yourself, but everyone else.

Oh, and by the way, people *want* open textbooks and open educational resources:

- [There's a $20,000 prize for an open textbook](http://www.saylor.org/otc/)
- [There's a $25,000 prize for open educational videos](http://whyopenedmatters.org/)

How do I produce a textbook?
--------------------------------
We're using github to track our contributions. Nobody will do it all. Therefore:

- [Pick a piece to contribute from the compiler course mapping outline](http://www.saylor.org/content/coursemapping/CourseMappingFormCS304.xls)
- Write or record what you can, push to github.
- Solicit feedback.

If you want to go above and beyond, try contributing for other courses as well.

- [Course mapping forms across various courses](http://www.saylor.org/course-mapping-forms/)

How can I produce educational videos?
-------------------------------------
The mechanics are simple:

- When recording a screen, use [screencasting software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_screencasting_software).
- Otherwise, use a camera, and video editing software.

Making a good video is more challenging:

- [You must watch this first](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/khan-academy-and-the-effectiveness-of-science-videos/).
- [Khan academy is nice, but there are better ways](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/you-khant-ignore-how-students-learn/)
